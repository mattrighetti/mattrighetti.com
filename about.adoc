== Hello!

I am Mattia and I'm a software engineer based in Luxembourg. My main
interests are distributes systems, performance optimization, databases and
microservices but I also enjoy going on the frontend side sometimes.

I'm an SDE Intern @ Amazon and I am finishing my MSc in software engineering,
in particular I am working on https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric[Hyperledger
Fabric] and model driven development for my thesis.

You can find me on https://github.com/mattrighetti[GitHub].
