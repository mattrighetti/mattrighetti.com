== Hey there!

I am Mattia and I'm a software engineer from Italy. My main interests are
distributed systems, performance optimization, databases and microservices but I
also have experience with frontend, don't tell anyone.

I am currently finishing my MSc in software engineering, in particular I am
working on https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric[Hyperledger Fabric] and model
driven development for my thesis.

You can find me on https://github.com/mattrighetti[GitHub].
