This is a space that I want to use to talk about stuff that I'm working on in a
"short" format.

I don't usually have the time and patience to write long format blogs,
especially when I'm working on something and I learn something interesting that
definitely does not need 1000 words blog. So I got inspired and created this section,
which wants to be a little bit like x.com posts. Short, fast and all in a thread.
