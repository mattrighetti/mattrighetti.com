We're on a rollercoaster, one day we can get away with an easy solution and the
next it's a lot more complext than that. Day 4 was pretty easy, so
https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/5[Day 5] won't be :) Let's take a look at the
problem.

You can find the final code @ https://github.com/mattrighetti/advent-of-code/tree/master/2023/day5[advent-of-code/2023/day5]

We're given this input sample

```input
seeds: 79 14 55 13

seed-to-soil map:
50 98 2
52 50 48

soil-to-fertilizer map:
0 15 37
37 52 2
39 0 15

fertilizer-to-water map:
49 53 8
0 11 42
42 0 7
57 7 4

water-to-light map:
88 18 7
18 25 70

light-to-temperature map:
45 77 23
81 45 19
68 64 13

temperature-to-humidity map:
0 69 1
1 0 69

humidity-to-location map:
60 56 37
56 93 4
```

The initial row has 4 different seed values, each seed value has to be mapped to
the corresponding value in each block. Each block (i.e `seed-to-soil`) has
different rows that contain the ranges to which each initial value has to be
mapped to, the first block has two different mappings: source range (98, 100),
destination range (50, 52), left range is always excluded.

Let's take seed `79`, if we map it with `seed-to-soil` we get `81`, this is
because 79 lies in the range represented by the line `52 50 48` which is has
source range `(50, 50 + 48) = (50, 98)` and maps those values to `(52, 52 + 48) = (52, 100)`.

We have to get the location of each seed, which we can get by performing the
mappings of each block from top to bottom.

As in many other cases, I would start off by creating a struct which contains
mapping values that we later could use.

```rust
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
struct Map {
    src: u64,
    dst: u64,
    rng: u64,
}

impl Map {
    fn new(src: u64, dst: u64, rng: u64) -> Self {
        Map { src, dst, rng }
    }
}

impl From<&str> for Map {
    fn from(value: &str) -> Self {
        let vals: Vec<&str> = value.split(' ').collect();
        let dst = vals[0].parse().unwrap();
        let src = vals[1].parse().unwrap();
        let rng = vals[2].parse().unwrap();
        Map { src, dst, rng }
    }
}
```

I can now represent each map in the input file with a `Vec<Map>`, I would like
to implement the mapping logic on that data structure, let's define a local
trait for that.

```rust
trait IntoRangeMapping {
    fn get_mapped_value(&self, v: &u64) -> u64;
}

// iterates over all the map ranges
// and returns the corresponding mapped value
impl IntoRangeMapping for Vec<Map> {
    fn get_mapped_value(&self, v: &u64) -> u64 {
        for map in self {
            if (map.src..map.src + map.rng).contains(v) {
                return map.dst + (v - map.src);
            }
        }

        *v
    }
}
```

This is all we need to get past part 1

```rust
fn part1(input: &str) -> io::Result<u64> {
    let parts: Vec<&str> = input.split("\n\n").collect();

    let seeds: Vec<u64> = parts[0]
        .split(' ')
        .skip(1)
        .filter_map(|x| x.parse().ok())
        .collect();

    let mut mappings: Vec<Vec<Map>> = Vec::new();
    for i in 1..parts.len() {
        let maps: Vec<Map> = parts[i]
            .split('\n')
            .skip(1)
            .filter(|x| !x.is_empty())
            .map(Map::from)
            .collect();
        mappings.push(maps);
    }

    let mut locations: Vec<u64> = Vec::with_capacity(seeds.len());
    for seed in seeds {
        let mut value_map = seed;
        for i in 0..mappings.len() {
            value_map = mappings[i].get_mapped_value(&value_map);
        }
        locations.push(value_map);
    }

    Ok(locations.into_iter().min().unwrap())
}
```

As usual, a quick test

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    const INPUT: &str = r"seeds: 79 14 55 13

...

humidity-to-location map:
60 56 37
56 93 4";

    #[test]
    fn test_map_parse() {
        assert_eq!(Map::new(20, 30, 40), Map::from("30 20 40"));
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_range_mapping() {
        let rng_map = vec![Map::new(0, 5, 2), Map::new(6, 9, 3)];
        assert_eq!(5, rng_map.get_mapped_value(&0));
        assert_eq!(6, rng_map.get_mapped_value(&1));
        assert_eq!(3, rng_map.get_mapped_value(&3));
        assert_eq!(4, rng_map.get_mapped_value(&4));
        assert_eq!(5, rng_map.get_mapped_value(&5));
        assert_eq!(9, rng_map.get_mapped_value(&6));
        assert_eq!(10, rng_map.get_mapped_value(&7));
        assert_eq!(11, rng_map.get_mapped_value(&8));
        assert_eq!(9, rng_map.get_mapped_value(&9));
        assert_eq!(10, rng_map.get_mapped_value(&10));
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_part1() {
        assert_eq!(35, part1(INPUT).unwrap());
    }
}
```

Solution is correct! Let's move on to the troubling part 2.

We now are told that the first seed line does not represent single seeds, but a
range of seeds. Also, we now have to return the min value of all the new
locations found.

We could brute force the solution by keeping the same logic as above and find
the new location for each seed in the range, but it's going to take a lot of
time.

What we could do instead is do some operations on ranges, particularly we could
find where ranges end up in the final location, once we have all the location
ranges we have to take the min one.

Since we have to find overlapping ranges, let's add a method that does just that to the `Map` type.

```rust
impl Map {
    fn overlaps_with(&self, r_start: u64, r_end: u64) -> Option<(u64, u64)> {
        let left_overlap = cmp::max(r_start, self.src);
        let right_overlap = cmp::min(r_end, self.src + self.rng);

        match left_overlap < right_overlap {
            true => Some((left_overlap, right_overlap)),
            false => None,
        }
    }
}
```

I want to work with `Vec<Map>` here too, so let's add another method to our trait that will return the new mapped ranges given an initial range.

```rust
trait IntoRangeMapping {
    fn get_mapped_value(&self, v: &u64) -> u64;
    fn get_overlapping_ranges(
        &self,
        start_range: u64,
        end_range: u64,
    ) -> (Option<(u64, u64)>, Option<(u64, u64)>, Option<(u64, u64)>);
}

impl IntoRangeMapping for Vec<Map> {
    fn get_overlapping_ranges(
        &self,
        start_range: u64,
        end_range: u64,
    ) -> (Option<(u64, u64)>, Option<(u64, u64)>, Option<(u64, u64)>) {
        let mut overlapping = None;
        let mut left_range = None;
        let mut right_range = None;

        for map in self {
            if let Some((ol, or)) = map.overlaps_with(start_range, end_range) {
                overlapping = Some((ol - map.src + map.dst, or - map.src + map.dst));

                if ol > start_range {
                    left_range = Some((start_range, ol));
                }

                if or < end_range {
                    right_range = Some((or, end_range));
                }

                return (overlapping, left_range, right_range);
            }
        }

        (overlapping, left_range, right_range)
    }
}
```

`get_overlapping_ranges` will return `overlapping` which is the new mapped
range, if present, left_range and right_range in case the range map is contained
by the original range.

Let's make use of these newly created methods in the final solution

```rust
fn part2(input: &str) -> io::Result<u64> {
    let parts: Vec<&str> = input.split("\n\n").collect();

    // tuple indicating start and end values of range
    let mut seed_ranges: Vec<(u64, u64)> = parts[0]
        .split(' ')
        .skip(1)
        .filter_map(|x| x.parse().ok())
        .collect::<Vec<u64>>()
        .chunks(2)
        .map(|w| (w[0], w[0] + w[1]))
        .collect();

    // same as before
    let mut mappings: Vec<Vec<Map>> = Vec::new();
    for i in 1..parts.len() {
        let mapping: Vec<Map> = parts[i]
            .split('\n')
            .skip(1)
            .filter(|x| !x.is_empty())
            .map(Map::from)
            .collect();

        mappings.push(mapping);
    }

    // repeat step for each map until we end up
    // with final seed range locations
    for range_map in mappings {
        // keep track of new mapped ranges
        let mut next_ranges: Vec<(u64, u64)> = Vec::new();

        while let Some((start, end)) = seed_ranges.pop() {
            match range_map.get_overlapping_ranges(start, end) {
                (None, _, _) => {
                    // keep same mapping if there is no overlap
                    next_ranges.push((start, end));
                }
                (Some(overlapping), lr, rr) => {
                    next_ranges.push(overlapping);

                    // these need to be checked in case there is another
                    // overlap with other ranges maps
                    if let Some(lr) = lr {
                        seed_ranges.push(lr);
                    }

                    if let Some(rr) = rr {
                        seed_ranges.push(rr);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        seed_ranges = next_ranges.clone();
    }

    Ok(seed_ranges.into_iter().map(|x| x.0).min().unwrap())
}
```

Let's test this

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn test_part2() {
        assert_eq!(46, part2(INPUT).unwrap());
    }
}
```

Phew, I have to admit that this took me quite a bit! Part 2 solution is correct,
let's hope for an easier Day 6 :)
