https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3[Day 3] was no walk in the park; it had me
revisiting my approach several times.

You can find the final code @ https://github.com/mattrighetti/advent-of-code/tree/master/2023/day4[advent-of-code/2023/day3]

We have the following input

```input
467..114..
...*......
..35..633.
......#...
617*......
.....+.58.
..592.....
......755.
...$.*....
.664.598..
```

Part 1 of the problem wants us to return the sum of all the numbers that have a
symbol as a neighbor (`.` is not a symbol).

The problem is not trivial, I would like to break it down as much as possible so
that the solution is easier to read and understand.

At some point we will need to look at the neighbors of a `char`, so the first
function that I would implement is one that returns neighboring coordinates of a
coordinate.

```rust
type Coord = (usize, usize);

/// Returns neighboring coordinates that are inside of the matrix bounds
fn get_neighbors_coords(n: i32, m: i32, i: i32, j: i32) -> HashSet<Coord> {
    let coords = vec![
        (-1, -1),
        (-1, 0),
        (-1, 1),
        (0, -1),
        (0, 1),
        (1, 1),
        (1, 0),
        (1, -1),
    ];

    let mut nb = HashSet::new();
    for (x, y) in coords {
        nb.insert((i + x, j + y));
    }

    nb.into_iter()
        .filter(|(x, y)| !(*x < 0 || *y < 0 || *x >= n || *y >= m))
        .map(|(x, y)| (x as usize, y as usize))
        .collect()
}
```

I'll also need a small utility function to check if a char is a valid symbol or not

```rust
fn is_symbol(c: &char) -> bool {
    c.is_ascii_punctuation() && *c != '.'
}
```

I would like to also have a function that returns a number given the coordinate
of one of its digits. A number lies on a single row, so we can use a left and
right pointer and move them respectively to the leftmost and rightmost digit
value and parse the slice contained between the two pointers as a `u32`.

```rust
fn get_num_at_coord(matrix: &Vec<Vec<char>>, coord: &Coord) -> u32 {
    let row = coord.0;
    let (mut l, mut r) = (coord.1, coord.1);

    while l > 0 && matrix[row][l - 1].is_digit(10) {
        l -= 1;
    }

    while r < matrix[row].len() - 1 && matrix[row][r + 1].is_digit(10) {
        r += 1;
    }

    matrix[row][l..=r]
        .iter()
        .collect::<String>()
        .parse()
        .unwrap()
}
```

The last utility function that I would like to implement is the one that is
going to actually return the neighboring numbers of a coordinate.

```rust
/// Returns all the neighboring numbers given a matrix and a coordinate.
fn neighboring_numbers(matrix: &Vec<Vec<char>>, i: usize, j: usize) -> Vec<u32> {
    let mut num = Vec::new();
    let (n, m) = (matrix.len() as i32, matrix[0].len() as i32);
    for (x, y) in get_neighbors_coords(n, m, i as i32, j as i32) {
        if matrix[x][y].is_digit(10) {
            num.push((x, y));
        }
    }

    // I'm using a HashSet because I have to consider a single number given
    // the coordinates of one of its digits, but num could contain multiple
    // coordinates that belong to the same number
    //
    // Consider for example `..23#111.`
    // I would end up with
    // num = (0,2), (0,3), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7)
    // but `get_num_at_coord((0,2)) == get_num_at_coord((0,3)) == 23` and
    // `get_num_at_coord((0,5)) == get_num_at_coord((0,6)) == get_num_at_coord((0,6)) == 111`
    let mut pairs: HashSet<u32> = HashSet::new();
    for coord in num {
        pairs.insert(get_num_at_coord(matrix, &coord));
    }

    pairs.into_iter().collect()
}
```

I've cheated a little bit in this case.

This function will only return a correct
answer if and only if the neighboring numbers all differ from each other. I
come from the future and the input that is given to us seems to be okay with
this assumption, bear with me.
--

The core logic of part 1 is now trivial, we have to iterate through all the matrix and find all the neighboring numbers of symbols

```rust
fn part1(input: &str) -> io::Result<u32> {
    let mut mat: Vec<Vec<char>> = Vec::new();
    for line in input.lines() {
        mat.push(line.chars().collect());
    }

    let mut nums = Vec::new();
    for i in 0..mat.len() {
        for j in 0..mat[0].len() {
            if is_symbol(&mat[i][j]) {
                nums.extend(neighboring_numbers(&mat, i, j))
            }
        }
    }

    Ok(nums.iter().sum())
}
```

This should be enough to get us through part 1, let's run some tests to make sure everything is okay

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_get_neighbors_coors() {
        assert_eq!(
            HashSet::from_iter(vec![(1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1)]),
            get_neighbors_coords(7, 7, 0, 0)
        );
        assert_eq!(
            HashSet::from_iter(vec![(5, 6), (5, 5), (6, 5)]),
            get_neighbors_coords(7, 7, 6, 6)
        );
        assert_eq!(
            HashSet::from_iter(vec![
                (2, 2),
                (2, 3),
                (2, 4),
                (4, 2),
                (4, 3),
                (4, 4),
                (3, 2),
                (3, 4)
            ]),
            get_neighbors_coords(7, 7, 3, 3)
        );
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_part1() {
        assert_eq!(
            4361,
            part1(
                r"467..114..
...*......
..35..633.
......#...
617*......
.....+.58.
..592.....
......755.
...$.*....
.664.598.."
            )
            .unwrap()
        );
    }
}
```

Bingo! Part 1 passes, let's move on to Part 2.

Part 2 states that:

[quote]
--
A gear is any * symbol that is adjacent to exactly two part numbers. Its gear
ratio is the result of multiplying those two numbers together.
--

We have to return the sum of all the ratios in the input. We can reuse 100% of
what we wrote before, I would add a single function to return only valid ratios
neighboring numbers.

```rust
fn neighboring_number_pair(matrix: &Vec<Vec<char>>, i: usize, j: usize) -> Option<(u32, u32)> {
    let pairs = neighboring_numbers(matrix, i, j);

    match pairs.len() {
        2 => Some((pairs[0], pairs[1])),
        _ => None,
    }
}
```

With that, part 2 is very similar to part 1, we just have to iterate through the
matrix and sum all the values of the ratios that we find.

```rust
fn part2(input: &str) -> io::Result<u32> {
    let mut mat: Vec<Vec<char>> = Vec::new();
    for line in input.lines() {
        mat.push(line.chars().collect());
    }

    let mut sum = 0;
    for i in 0..mat.len() {
        for j in 0..mat[0].len() {
            if mat[i][j] == '*' {
                if let Some((n1, n2)) = neighboring_number_pair(&mat, i, j) {
                    sum += n1 * n2;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    Ok(sum)
}
```

More tests

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_part2() {
        assert_eq!(
            467835,
            part2(
                "467..114..
...*......
..35..633.
......#...
617*......
.....+.58.
..592.....
......755.
...$.*....
.664.598.."
            )
            .unwrap()
        );
        assert_eq!(
            (467 * 35) + (617 * 2) + (755 * 598),
            part2(
                "467..114..
...*......
..35..633.
......#...
617*2.....
.....+.58.
..592.....
......755.
...$.*....
.664.598.."
            )
            .unwrap()
        );
    }
}
```

There we go, part 2 is done! As I noted above, this solution is not 100% correct
as I've assumed that all the numbers that make up a ratio are different from
each other. Indeed, my solution will fail with this input

```input
467..114..
...*......
.467..633.
...$.*....
.664.598..
```

A quick test will show just that

```rust
#[test]
fn test_part2_alternative() {
    assert_eq!(
        (467 * 467) + (633 * 598),
        part2(
            "467..114..
...*......
.467..633.
...$.*....
.664.598.."
        )
        .unwrap()
    );
}
```

To solve this you just need to add more conditions to the `neighboring_numbers`
function, but I'm lazy and I won't do that today :)
