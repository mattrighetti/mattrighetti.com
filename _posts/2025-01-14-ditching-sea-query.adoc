title: "Can't Escape Good Old SQL"

Query builders and ORMs have been around for as long as I can remember, each
serving different purposes. ORMs, for example, allow you to focus on application
logic without worrying about SQL or database intricacies. However, this
convenience comes at a cost—using an ORM almost always means losing control over
what’s happening in your database. That’s a trade-off I’ve never been willing to
make in any of my projects.

Query builders on the other hand just... build queries.

At the time it seemed like the best of both worlds because you're still in
control of the query and you're getting a little hand by the framework to
generate your query.

During GSoC 2023 I got really interested in `sea-query`, which is a well known
query builder crate that also integrates well in their `sea-orm` crate. I really
liked the idea of having strongly typed database queries and having a database
model representation, so I gave it a shot.

With sea-query you can have all your database tables living alongside your code
like the following

```rust
/// This is a strongly typed version of your `environments` database table
/// with its columns
#[derive(Debug, sea_query::Iden)]
pub enum Environments {
    Table,
    Env,
    Key,
    Value,
    CreatedAt,
}
```

with that you can then create your queries like the following

```rust
/// inserts `key` and `value` to environment `env`
pub async fn insert(&self, env: &str, key: &str, var: &str) -> io::Result<()> {
    let (sql, values) = Query::insert()
        .into_table(Environments::Table)
        .columns([Environments::Env, Environments::Key, Environments::Value])
        .values([env.into(), Func::upper(key).into(), var.into()])
        .unwrap()
        .build_sqlx(SqliteQueryBuilder);

    sqlx::query_with(&sql, values)
        .execute(&self.db)
        .await
        .map_err(|e| std_err!("db error: {}", e))?;

    Ok(())
}
```

A year later I am now going back writing goold old SQL queries and I'm surprised
it took me that long. "Why?" you may wonder - well, mostly for the following
reasons:

- You don't get 100% of the SQL expressiveness
- It just does not work for complex queries, or looses its purpose
- Documentation covers basic examples and could be better

Let's say that you need an uncommon sql statement that only Postgres offers,
like `txid_current_snapshot()` - you simply won't find it in `sea-query`.

Even though mine could seem like a very uncommon SQL statement that you'll
probably never need (you could argue that that is also the reason why it's not
being developed), you will for certain end up in a scenario where
something is not available in the crate.

Not too bad, as `sea-query` provides a solution for this—you can still write raw
SQL using `Expr::cust("txid_current_snapshot()")` when needed. While this is
useful for cases where the query builder lacks a specific feature, it comes at
the cost of losing strong typing—the very reason you chose to use the query
builder in the first place.

What if you're not sure how to do something with `sea-query`? I’m no genius, but
I've lost count of the times I've searched for a solution, only to come up
empty—or worse, discovered that it's simply not possible and had to resort to
hacks to make it work.

Documentation does not help at all here, it basically covers the simplest
examples and it won't get you that far when you have to write complicated
queries and you need to understand how to glue all the piecies together.

Eventually, this starts to feel like learning a new SQL dialect on top of
the real SQL: you think of the query you need, check the documentation, and
come up empty-handed. Then you turn to Google, searching Stack Overflow or
GitHub Issues, hoping someone has asked the same question. If you're lucky,
you'll find the answer—after wasting countless minutes looking for it.

This is why I've ditched the idea of query builders entirely and started writing
raw SQL queries again. It's not perfect, but it's probably the best we can do.

I'll remind myself not to fall into that trap again when the next shiny,
promising SQL alternative comes along.
