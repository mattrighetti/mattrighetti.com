Last week I was studying
https://github.com/Ranchero-Software/NetNewsWire[NetNewsWire]
to see if I could find something interesting
to implement in my projects.

A cool thing that I’ve found is that the project does not use CoreData,
instead it makes use of SQLite. The project’s author explained on the
Sundell podcast episode #95 some good points on why adopting SQLite has
improved performance greatly.

Sometimes you may want something more from your data storage, you want
more control, or you just want to work with tables and SQL lite statements.

I wanted to try this because I don't have a good relationship with CoreData
and CloudKit integration, I HATE GUIs and also because I work a lot on backend
services so I prefer to work with the data layer and optimize indexing and queryies
myself and having them written down.

== Introducing FMDB

https://github.com/ccgus/fmdb[FMDB] is an Objective-C wrapper around SQLite,
it's open source and it's really easy to setup and it happens to be the only
good library that lets you do that (I may be wrong here, if you know other
good libraries please let me know, I would love to try them out!)

== Setup

Let's create a new Xcode project, I'll call mine SQLiteIntro.

This app is not going to be really complex as I just want to give a
little introduction to the topic, just the right amount to give you an idea
on how working with SQL looks like in a swift project.

== DataWrapper

It's good practice to separate logic in its dedicated class/struct. In this case,
since we're working with an SQL database I want to create a class that will abstract
a bit of data layer logic so that code will be a lot cleaner going forward.

```swift
final class DataWrapper: ObservableObject {
    private let db: FMDatabase

    init(fileName: String = "test") {
        // 1 - Get filePath of the SQLite file
        let fileURL = try! FileManager.default
            .url(for: .applicationSupportDirectory, in: .userDomainMask, appropriateFor: nil, create: true)
            .appendingPathComponent("\(fileName).sqlite")

        // 2 - Create FMDatabase from filePath
        let db = FMDatabase(url: fileURL)

        // 3 - Open connection to database
        guard db.open() else {
            fatalError("Unable to open database")
        }

        // 4 - Initial table creation
        do {
            try db.executeUpdate("create table if not exists users(username varchar(255) primary key, age integer)", values: nil)
        } catch {
            fatalError("cannot execute query")
        }

        self.db = db
    }
}
```

This is all you need to start, simple right?

The code is straightforward: when the DataWrapper class is initially created it
will look for the database file, if the file is not present FMDB will create a
database for you with that path. Finally it opens a connection to the database
and creates the `user` table.

== Model

To work with the database records I want to create a `User` struct, in my
example I'm going to include some other JSON related stuff because I'm going to
use it later to create users with random name using some web APIs.

```swift
struct User: Hashable, Decodable {
    let username: String
    let age: Int

    init(username: String, age: Int) {
        self.username = username
        self.age = age
    }

    init?(from result: FMResultSet) {
        if let username = result.string(forColumn: "username") {
            self.username = username
            self.age = Int(result.int(forColumn: "age"))
        } else {
            return nil
        }
    }

    private enum CodingKeys : String, CodingKey {
        case username = "first_name"
    }

    init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
        let container = try decoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        username = try container.decode(String.self, forKey: .username)
        age = Int.random(in: 1..<100)
    }
}
```

`FMResultSet` is what you will always get when you execute a query from the
database, even if you expect a single record, or an empty result, that's why
it's useful to have a dedicated init function to handle all the setup logic in
this case.

== Combine and MVVM

Since I'm using SwiftUI I'd like the `DataWrapper` to be reactive and notify the
view of possible changes in the database. Going back to the implementation of
`DataWrapper`, I'm adding a `@Published` array of users so that I can display
them in a `List`.

```swift
final class DataWrapper: ObservableObject {
    private let db: FMDatabase

    @Published var users = [User]()

    ...
}
```

To fetch users from the database and publish them as soon as the database is
opend we need to create a method to query all users and set them to
DataWrapper's users variable after the database initialization.

```swift
func getAllUsers() -> [User] {
    var users = [User]()
    do {
        let result = try db.executeQuery("select username, age from users", values: nil)
        while result.next() {
            if let user = User(from: result) {
                users.append(user)
            }
        }
        return users
    } catch {
        return users
    }
}
```

and place this call at the bottom of the `init` method of `DataWrapper`

```swift
users = getAllUsers()
```

Now when you first fire `DataWrapper` it will automatically
fetch all the users and they will be ready to be used in SwiftUI.

I'll create an `insert` function that I'm going to use later

```swift
func insert(_ user: User) {
    do {
        try db.executeUpdate(
            """
            insert into users (username, age)
            values (?, ?)
            """,
            values: [user.username, user.age]
        )
        users.append(user)
    } catch {
        fatalError("cannot insert user: \(error)")
    }
}
```

== A Quick SwiftUI View

I want to create a `List` that displays all the users that the database contains
and also create a simple function that queries a web API to get a random username
and inserts a new user into the database.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @EnvironmentObject var db: DataWrapper

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            List(db.users, id: \.self) { user in
                HStack {
                    Text(user.username)
                    Spacer()
                    Text("\(user.age)")
                }
            }

            .navigationTitle("Users")
            .toolbar {
                ToolbarItem(id: "plus", placement: .navigationBarTrailing, showsByDefault: true) {
                    Button(action: {
                        createRandomUser()
                    }, label: {
                        Image(systemName: "plus")
                    })
                }
            }
        }
    }

    private func createRandomUser() {
        let url = URL(string: "https://random-data-api.com/api/name/random_name")!
        let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { data, response, error in
            guard let data = data else {
                fatalError("No data")
            }

            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                let user = try! JSONDecoder().decode(User.self, from: data)
                db.insert(user)
            }
        }
        task.resume()
    }
}
```

If you run your app now, you will be presented with an empty
list, but if you press the plus button you will start to
insert stuff in the database and names will begin to appear
reactively in your list.

== Conclusion

This was a very simple scenario that might now show a huge
boot in performance with respect to the CoreData version, but
it's a different way to store data in a more familiar SQLite database.

If you want more control over your data, SQLite and the power of SQL
will certainly not let you down. SQLite could improve
performance in applications that need fine grained control
and aimed query optimizations. It's also easier to sync data
with CloudKit since now you just have to sync the sqlite file
without dealing with all the CoreData tables and different versions.

I'm working on an article that talks about migration strategies with SQLite,
so if you want to know more stay tuned!
