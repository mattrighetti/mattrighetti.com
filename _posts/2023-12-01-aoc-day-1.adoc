title: Advent of Code 2023 - Day 1
---

It's December and a new https://adventofcode.com[Advent of Code] is ready to be
solved.

This year I'm picking Rust, again. Let's go ahead and solve https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1[Day 1]!

You can find the final code @ https://github.com/mattrighetti/advent-of-code/tree/master/2023/day1[advent-of-code/2023/day1]

Our input is a multi-line text file, each line has variable length and consists
of a sequence of chars and digits, here's the example that is given to us

```input
1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet
```

The problem goes on by saying that each line contains a _calibration value_ that
we need to get. In order to obtain that value, we have to combine the first digit and the
last digit that we find on each line.

Let's take the second line for example: if we walk every char we encounter `3` as
the first digit and `8` as last digit, therefore, the _calibration value_ is
`38`.

What about the last line? Well, we only have a single digit, which is `7`, and
that is both our first and last digit. The _calibration value_ for the last line
is `77`.

This problem is pretty trivial, just what we wanted to warm ourselves for the 24 days ahead.

We have to start by reading the entire input file. It could be a useful exercise
to code an input reader directly in the program but I like to handle this part
by just piping the input into `stdin` with `cat`.

In Rust we can just create a mutable `String` and inject the content of `stdin` into it.

```rust
use std::io::{self, Read};

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    let mut input = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_to_string(&mut input);
    println!("{}", input);
    Ok(())
}
```

We need to import `std::io::Read` to use `read_to_string`, otherwise the
compiler will complain that that method is not implemented by `stdin`.

You can now run this command to see that everything is working as expected:

```shell session
$ cat input | cargo run -
```

Now that we have our input, I want to create a function that takes an input and that is returns all the logic for part 1.

```rust
fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    let mut input = String::new();
    let _ = io::stdin().read_to_string(&mut input);

    writeln!(io::stdout(), "{}", part1(&input)?)?;
    Ok(())
}

fn part1(input: &str) -> io::Result<u32> {
    todo!()
}
```

Everything is setup, now we need to work on the solution.

What I would do in this case is:

. Iterate over each line
. Map each line to a the corresponding _calibration value_
. Sum all the values

```rust
fn part1(input: &str) -> io::Result<()> {
    let sum: u32 = input
        .lines()
        .map(|line| {
            // From the line we get an array of `char` and we try to parse each
            // one into a digit with `to_digit`.
            let digits: Vec<u32> = line
                .chars()
                // `to_digit` returns an `Option<u32>` and sice we only need valid
                // digits we can get rid of all the `None` values by using
                // `flat_map`.
                .flat_map(|x| x.to_digit(10))
                .collect();

            // We parse the calibration value by taking the first and last digit
            (digits[0] * 10) + digits[digits.len() - 1]
        })
        .sum();

    writeln!(io::stdout(), "{}", sum)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

To make sure that we did everything correctly I usually do a quick and dirty test


```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_part1() {
        assert_eq!(part1("ad1f3").unwrap(), 13);
        assert_eq!(part1("ad1\na3\n11\n0").unwrap(), 11 + 33 + 11 + 0);
    }
}
```

By running `cargo test` everything seems to pass, and if we paste the output
solution returned by `cat input | cargo run -`, the AoC portal tells us that the
solution is indeed correct.

We now have access to the second part of the problem: we are told that *some* of
the digits are actually spelled with letters. For example, `7pqrstsixteen` has a
_calibration value_ of `76` because the first digit is 7 and the last one is
`six`.

We could reuse our `part1` function if we could somehow replace spelled digits
with its digit char, but a simple replace function is not going to do it in this
case. Take a look at `eightwothree` for example, you can have different outcomes
depending on the order of replacement that you apply:

. You may end up with `8wo3` if you replace `eight` before `two`
. You may end up with `eigh23` if you replace `two` before `eight`

The problem description tells us that in this case the correct solution would be
`8wo3`, so I guess that we need to replace spelled digits in order of
occurrence.

In this case, we can't easily reuse the `part1` function, but don't worry, we
can create a brand new function to solve this second part of the problem. I
would solve this second part by doing the following: 

. For each line find the indices of each digit or spelled digit
. Keep track of max digit and min digit
. Map line with found digit at min and max position
. Sum all the values

Rust has a nice function that returns all the indices of a certain
substring in a string: `match_indices`, we can make use of that.

Here's a quick sketch of the solution

```rust
fn repl_digits(x: &str) -> u32 {
    let digits = vec![
        ("1", "1"),
        ("2", "2"),
        ("3", "3"),
        ("4", "4"),
        ("5", "5"),
        ("6", "6"),
        ("7", "7"),
        ("8", "8"),
        ("9", "9"),
        ("0", "0"),
        ("one", "1"),
        ("two", "2"),
        ("three", "3"),
        ("four", "4"),
        ("five", "5"),
        ("six", "6"),
        ("seven", "7"),
        ("eight", "8"),
        ("nine", "9"),
        ("zero", "0"),
    ];

    // Initialize the first and last occurrences
    let mut first: (&str, usize) = ("", x.len());
    let mut last: (&str, usize) = ("", 0);

    for (substr, digit) in &digits {
        // Get the array of indices for the current substring
        let occ: Vec<_> = x.match_indices(substr).map(|x| x.0).collect();
        // If there's no occurrence, move to the next substr
        if occ.len() == 0 {
            continue;
        }

        // The indices array is ordered and we only need the first and last
        // occurrences
        let (min, max) = (occ[0], occ[occ.len() - 1]);

        // If the min index found is lte the current min index
        // keep track of the new first digit and its index
        if min <= first.1 {
            first = (digit, min);
        }

        // If the max index found is gte the current max index
        // keep track of the new last digit and its index
        if max >= last.1 {
            last = (digit, max);
        }
    }

    // Parse value resulting by concatenating the two
    // digits
    format!("{}{}", first.0, last.0)
        .parse::<u32>()
        .unwrap()
}

fn part2(input: &str) -> io::Result<u32> {
    let sum: u32 = input.lines().map(repl_digits).sum();

    Ok(sum)
}
```

Quick test to make sure that everything is working properly

```

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_repl_digits() {
        assert_eq!(repl_digits("eightwothree"), 83);
        assert_eq!(repl_digits("13eightwothree"), 13);
        assert_eq!(repl_digits("13oneight"), 18);
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_part2() {
        assert_eq!(part2("ad1f3").unwrap(), 13);
        assert_eq!(part2("ad1\na3\n11\n0").unwrap(), 11 + 33 + 11 + 0);
        assert_eq!(part2("zero").unwrap(), 0);
        assert_eq!(part2("three").unwrap(), 33);
        assert_eq!(part2("1\nthree\nonetwothree2three").unwrap(), 11 + 33 + 13);
        assert_eq!(
            part2(
                r"two1nine
                eightwothree
                abcone2threexyz
                xtwone3four
                4nineeightseven2
                zoneight234
                7pqrstsixteen"
            )
            .unwrap(),
            281
        );
    }
}
```

`cargo test` gives us a green light, and indeed the solution is correct according to the AoC portal.

Yay, day 1 is done!
