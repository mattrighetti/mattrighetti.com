Hey there! This has been yet another _reading code_ week, again :) but bear with
me a little longer.

If you read the previous articles you already know that coding should start on
the 29th of May, before that date you should spend time bonding with the
community and other people participating in GSoC 2023.

I did write some more (very little) filtering logic for query params that might
come with each request, you can find all those in the
https://metrics.torproject.org/onionoo.html#parameters[onionoo protocol
specifications]. Later this week I'm also going to setup an initial CI/CD
pipeline to automatically test code when commits are pushed to any remote branch
so that I'm sure I'm not pushing broken stuff.

Plus, I've also started to lay down another crucial thing that I
talked about last week: *responses -> table columns* mappings.

Right now the Network Status Team is loading data into their databases and we're
going to have access to the new instance
https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/tpa/team/-/issues/41167[next week] as the
issue is getting noticed and is moving forward.

I had to write down where data is to be queried and how, because there were some
mismatches in responses field names and table columns. A first attempt to
illustrate the mappings is provided in this
https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/network-health/metrics/networkstatusapi/-/issues/1[issue]
and is now being discussed with other community members.

This docs will be necessary when I'll have to actually query the databases to
contruct the responses that the service returns. I still don't have access to pg
as you know, but I can replicate a mirrored instance locally with docker since I have the
entire
https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/network-health/metrics/descriptorParser/-/tree/main/src/main/sql[database
schema] at my disposal, and you have too of course.

This is how the database currently looks

Things are going smoothly for the moment, the project is almost 100%
setup and soon I'll start to code the APIs. I've now participated in more
than two weekly meetings and I'm starting to understand more of how the Tor
Project community operates and I'm happy to be part of it.

See you next week for more updates!
