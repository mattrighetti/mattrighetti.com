The other day I working on a side project of mine and I stumbled upon a bug in
my code that I couldn't immediately figure out how to solve.

The task is pretty simple:

. Create a file with some text in it
. Spawn whatever editor you want to work with the file
. Read all the file and return its content

This is a very similar process that `git` runs whenever you want to commit
something

```rust
pub fn spawn_with(data: &[u8]) -> Result<Vec<u8>> {
    let editor = editor_cmd();
    let pb = env::current_dir()?.join(".ENVELOPE_EDITMSG");

    let mut file = OpenOptions::new()
        .write(true)
        .read(true)
        .create(true)
        .truncate(true)
        .open(&pb)?;

    file.write_all(data)
	    .map_err(|e| std_err!("error writing data to file: {}", e))?;
    file.write(b"\n\n# Comment variables to remove them")?;

    let args = &[pb.to_str().unwrap()];
    let cmd = ChildProcess::new(&editor, args, &[]);

    // this command is blocking, so it's going to wait
    // for the child process to exit before proceeding
    cmd.run_shell_command()
        .map_err(|e| std_err!("error running child process: {}", e))?;

    let mut buf = Vec::new();
    file.read_to_end(&mut buf).unwrap();

    std::fs::remove_file(pb)?;
    Ok(buf)
}
```

Can you spot the issue? Well, I couldn't at first and the lack of tests sure
didn't help.

Let's print some stuff and see where we end up

```rust
pub fn spawn_with(data: &[u8]) -> Result<Vec<u8>> {
    // ...

    let mut file = OpenOptions::new()
        .write(true)
        .read(true)
        .create(true)
        .truncate(true)
        .open(&pb)?;

	println!("{:?}", file);

    // ...

    Ok(buf)
}
```

```output
File { fd: 7, path: "/home/matt/Developer/envelope/.ENVELOPE_EDITMSG", read: true, write: true }
```

My editor opens the file correctly and I can see all the data that I wanted in
it. That part of the process looks okay so far. I am still getting an empty
buffer out of this function though, why is that?

The answer lies in how Unix systems (in my case) handle files.

Unix systems have a system-wide *open file table* that keeps track of numerous
info about files opened by processes, like: current offset, underlying inode, if
the file is either readable, writeable or both etc.

Whenever a process opens a file, the operating system will return a *file
descriptor* to the process, which is going to later be used to refer to a
specific file in the *open file table* of the OS. The `fd` (file descriptor)
field in the https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/struct.File.html[`File`]
struct above refers to exactly that.

The https://linux.die.net/man/2/open[`open`] syscall is the one responsible
for creating a new file descriptor in the system-wide OFT and returning its
values to the process so that operations can be made on it. Here is its
signature

```c
int open(const char *pathname, int flags, mode_t mode);
```

When the process obtains the file descriptor, it can read and write to it
(granted it has permissions to do so), and guess what, `read` and `write`
syscalls are made just for that. This are their signatures

```c
ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);

ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);
```

Both of them take a file descriptor as first argument, that's the `int` value
returned by the `open` syscall. They both take a `size_t count` as last argument
which tells the size in bytes that the function should read/write. The middle
argument is in both cases a pointer to a buffer that tells where bytes should be
taken from/placed in.

We're now missing a piece of the puzzle to completely understand how this all
comes together: the file's _current offset_.

The _current offset_ is used by the OS to keep track of where the next read or
write will begin reading from or writing to within the file.

We humans do pretty much the same thing when we are reading or writing
something. Think about it, when you are reading a 800 pages long book you may
start reading the first 60 pages in a single day and then you bookmark that page
so that when you come back to it later you know exactly where you previously
left off. Something similar happens when you are writing an essay, you continue
on the same line, word after word, character after character.

Operating Systems work very similarly in this case and they use the file's
current offset to do just that. Each time a file gets created in the OFT with
the `open` syscall, its current offset is set to 0. Each `write` and `read`
operation is going to increment that current offset value by `size_t count`
implicitly.

We can see this in action by using the `strace` tool to inspect all the syscalls
invoked by the process:

```shell session
$ strace -e trace=open,openat,write,read,close,lseek target/debug/run_function
```

And this is the output that I get

```shell session
...
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/tmp/ENVELOPE_EDITMSG", O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC|O_CLOEXEC, 0666) = 7
write(7, "\n\n# Comment variables to remove "..., 36) = 36
--- SIGCHLD {si_signo=SIGCHLD, si_code=CLD_EXITED, si_pid=28814, si_uid=1000, si_status=0, si_utime=1, si_stime=0} ---
lseek(7, 0, SEEK_CUR)                   = 36
read(7, "\n", 8)                        = 1
read(7, "", 7)                          = 0
close(7)                                = 0
...
```

For simplicity, you can interpret `openat` as `open` in this case, they are very
similar.
--

This is exactly what we expected to get, right? The `openat` syscall created the
file with the directives `O_RDWR` (read and write), `O_CREAT` (create),
`O_TRUNC` (trucate), `O_CLOEXEC` (close, eventually) and it returns the
file descriptor value of 7. The function then writes the string (buffer)
which is 36 bytes in size to the file descriptor 7. Finally, it calls `read`
twice, initially it tries to read 8 bytes from file descriptor 7 and `"\n"` is
what's been able read, the second one tries to read up to 7 bytes but
there's nothing left to read, so the buffer returned is empty.

See that `lseek` function before the `read`? That is the syscall to *explicitly*
position the current offset of the file descriptor. Here's the signature

```c
off_t lseek(int fd, off_t offset, int whence);
```

As usual, the first arg is the file descriptor. The second arg is the file
offset, which positions the current offset to a particular location within the
file. The last arg determines how the seek is performed and it has 3 different
possible values:

. `SEEK_CUR`: the offset is set to its current location + offset bytes.
. `SEEK_SET`: the offset is set to offset bytes.
. `SEEK_END`: the offset is set to the file size + offset bytes.

Therefore, `lseek(7, 0, SEEK_CUR) = 36` positions the offset to current location
+ 0 bytes (which was 36 bytes after the first write).

It is clear now why the original function that I wrote returned an empty buffer,
   here's what happens:

. The file is opened with current offset set to 0
. I write a bunch of data to the file itself and the current offset is set to
  the number of bytes that I write to the file
. Lastly, when I call `read_to_end`, nothing gets read because there is
  nothing to read since the current offset already is set to the end of the file

I was mislead by the `read_to_end` documentation which tells us that

[quote]

Read all bytes until EOF in this source, placing them into `buf`.
--

Now we know that it's going to read all bytes *starting from the current offset*
until EOF.

Let's move on to the solution, which is trivial at this point. We have two
different options:

Since `File` implements the
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Seek.html[`Seek`] trait, we can
explicitly reposition the current offset of the file descriptor to the beginning
of the file just before calling `read_to_end`, the following would be the same
as calling `lseek(7, 0, SEEK_SET)`.

```rust
pub fn spawn_with(data: &[u8]) -> Result<Vec<u8>> {
    // ...

    cmd.run_shell_command()
        .map_err(|e| std_err!("error running child process: {}", e))?;

    // Reposition the offset at the start of the file
    file.seek(SeekFrom::Start(0)).unwrap();

    let mut buf = Vec::new();
    file.read_to_end(&mut buf).unwrap();

    // ...
}
```

We know that each time a file is opened, its current offset is set to 0 by
default, so the other option would be to re-open the file before calling
`read_to_end`

```rust
pub fn spawn_with(data: &[u8]) -> Result<Vec<u8>> {
    // ...

    cmd.run_shell_command()
        .map_err(|e| std_err!("error running child process: {}", e))?;

    let mut file = OpenOptions::new()
        .read(true)
        .open(&pb)?;

    let mut buf = Vec::new();
    file.read_to_end(&mut buf).unwrap();

    // ...
}
```

This time, since we just need to read the file, we can just open the file with
read-only permissions.

These solutions both solve my initial problem.

If I was in a performance critical environment and I'd have to choose between
the two I would go the first one because `lseek` is a much cheaper syscall than
`open` for obvious reasons.

EDIT: Repositioning the current offset does not behave as expected on macOS, maybe
I'll try and investigate why on a later post, but for the moment it seems like I'm stuck
with re-opening the file if I want this to work as expected across Linux and macOS.
