title: Advent of Code 2023 - Day 7
---

You can find the final code @ https://github.com/mattrighetti/advent-of-code/tree/master/2023/day7[advent-of-code/2023/day7]

https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/7[Day 7] was pretty cool, not hard, but
a bit verbose.

We have the following input

```rust
32T3K 765
T55J5 684
KK677 28
KTJJT 220
QQQJA 483
```

You get a list of hands, and your goal is to order them based on the strength of
each hand. A hand consists of five cards labeled one of A, K, Q, J, T, 9, 8, 7,
6, 5, 4, 3, or 2. The relative strength of each card follows this order,
where A is the highest and 2 is the lowest.

Every hand is exactly one type: Five of a kind, Four of a kind, Full house, Two pairs, One pair, High card
--

What we have to do in this case is reorder the cards that are listed in the
input with the logic explained above, once the deck is reordered we have to
multiply its index with the hand bid.

Let's start with a struct that encapsulates a hand

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Hand {
    typ: HandType,
    cards: Vec<Card>,
    bid: u32,
}

#[derive(Debug)]
enum HandType {
    HighCard,
    OnePair,
    TwoPair,
    ThreeOfAKind,
    FullHouse,
    FourOfAKind,
    FiveOfAKind,
}

impl From<&Vec<char>> for HandType {
    fn from(value: &Vec<char>) -> Self {
        let mut occurrencies: HashMap<char, u32> = HashMap::new();
        for card in value {
            match occurrencies.get_mut(&card) {
                Some(v) => {
                    *v += 1;
                }
                None => {
                    occurrencies.insert(*card, 1);
                }
            }
        }

        let values: Vec<u32> = occurrencies.into_values().collect();
        let r#type = match values.len() {
            1 => HandType::FiveOfAKind,
            4 => HandType::OnePair,
            5 => HandType::HighCard,
            3 => match values.contains(&3) {
                true => HandType::ThreeOfAKind,
                false => HandType::TwoPair,
            },
            2 => match values.contains(&4) {
                true => HandType::FourOfAKind,
                false => HandType::FullHouse,
            },
            _ => panic!("hand with too many cards"),
        };

        r#type
    }
}

impl From<&str> for Hand {
    fn from(value: &str) -> Self {
        let (cards, bid) = value.split_once(" ").unwrap();

        let cards = cards.chars().collect();
        let typ = HandType::from(&cards);
        let cards = cards.iter().map(Card::from).collect();

        Self {
            cards,
            bid: bid.parse().unwrap(),
            typ,
        }
    }
}

#[derive(Debug)]
enum Card {
    N2,
    N3,
    N4,
    N5,
    N6,
    N7,
    N8,
    N9,
    T,
    Jack,
    Qeen,
    King,
    Ace,
}

impl From<&char> for Card {
    fn from(value: &char) -> Self {
        match value {
            'A' => Card::Ace,
            'Q' => Card::Qeen,
            'K' => Card::King,
            'J' => Card::Jack,
            'T' => Card::T,
            '9' => Card::N9,
            '8' => Card::N8,
            '7' => Card::N7,
            '6' => Card::N6,
            '5' => Card::N5,
            '4' => Card::N4,
            '3' => Card::N3,
            '2' => Card::N2,
            _ => panic!("invalid card"),
        }
    }
}
```

Each time we parse our `Hand` from an input line, we immediately get its type,
we should have all the basic logic setup and we can proceed with the
reordering, but first: TESTS.

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_handtype_from() {
        assert_eq!(
            HandType::FiveOfAKind,
            HandType::from(&vec!['A', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'A'])
        );
        assert_eq!(
            HandType::FourOfAKind,
            HandType::from(&vec!['A', 'Q', 'Q', 'Q', 'Q'])
        );
        assert_eq!(
            HandType::FullHouse,
            HandType::from(&vec!['A', 'A', 'J', 'J', 'J'])
        );
        assert_eq!(
            HandType::TwoPair,
            HandType::from(&vec!['A', 'A', 'K', 'K', 'Q'])
        );
        assert_eq!(
            HandType::OnePair,
            HandType::from(&vec!['A', 'T', 'A', 'K', 'Q'])
        );
        assert_eq!(
            HandType::HighCard,
            HandType::from(&vec!['A', 'T', 'Q', 'J', 'K'])
        );
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_hand_from() {
        assert_eq!(
            Hand::new(vec!['A', 'Q', 'J', 'K', 'T'], 10, HandType::HighCard),
            Hand::from("AQJKT 10")
        );
        assert_eq!(
            Hand::new(vec!['A', 'A', 'K', 'K', 'T'], 35, HandType::TwoPair),
            Hand::from("AAKKT 35")
        );
    }
}
```

Everything seems to be fine, let's move on with the ordering logic. You may
argue that all those enums are useless, or that you could have solved this
problem without them. I've used enums for a cool feature that Rust gives us for
free in this case: ordering!

Turns out that we can `#[derive]` ordering without writing a single line of
code, but how exactly does Rust decide which value comes first and which value
comes next? That is on us! Values are ordered exactly the way they are defined.

If you take a look at the `Card` enum type, Rust will give automatically derive
that `N2 < N3 < N4` and so on, how cool is that? Let's derive more stuff in our enums.

```rust
// ordering is also derived for this struct, it will sort first by
// `typ` and then by `cards` and then by `bid`
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord)]
struct Hand {
    typ: HandType,
    cards: Vec<Card>,
    bid: u32,
}

#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord)]
enum HandType {
    ...
}

#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord)]
enum Card {
    ...
}
```

Quick proof

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    #[test]
    fn test_card_ord() {
        let mut rnd = vec![
            Card::Ace,
            Card::Qeen,
            Card::King,
            Card::Jack,
            Card::T,
            Card::N6,
            Card::N9,
        ];

        rnd.sort();

        assert_eq!(
            vec![
                Card::N6,
                Card::N9,
                Card::T,
                Card::Jack,
                Card::Qeen,
                Card::King,
                Card::Ace,
            ],
            rnd
        );
    }
}
```

I just discovered this to be honest, that's super cool, imagine writing all the
ordering logic for all those types and cards?! No thanks.

Let's sketch part 1 solution, which is trivial at this point

```rust
fn part1(input: &str) -> io::Result<u32> {
    let mut hands: Vec<Hand> = input.lines().map(Hand::from).collect();
    hands.sort();

    let sum = hands
        .into_iter()
        .enumerate()
        .map(|(i, card)| card.bid * (i as u32 + 1))
        .sum();

    Ok(sum)
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_part1() {
        assert_eq!(
            6440,
            part1("32T3K 765\nT55J5 684\nKK677 28\nKTJJT 220\nQQQJA 483").unwrap()
        )
    }
}
```

Success! Curious about part 2?

Part 2 tells us that we can now use the `Jack` card as a jolly and change it to
whichever card is needed to make the hand the strogest possible. When we need to
order by cards though we should consider `J` as the weakest card, so `J < N2 <
N3` etc.

Since we relied on `#[derive]` for ordering, I'll need to edit the position of
`J` in `Card` and break `part1` solution. I'll also need to edit the logic with
which I calculate which hand `typ` we have.

```rust
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord)]
enum Card {
    Jack,
    N2,
    N3,
    N4,
    N5,
    N6,
    N7,
    N8,
    N9,
    T,
    Qeen,
    King,
    Ace,
}

impl From<&Vec<char>> for HandType {
    fn from(value: &Vec<char>) -> Self {
        let mut occurrencies: HashMap<char, u32> = HashMap::new();
        for card in value {
            match occurrencies.get_mut(&card) {
                Some(v) => {
                    *v += 1;
                }
                None => {
                    occurrencies.insert(*card, 1);
                }
            }
        }

        // remove all ocurrencies of J
        if let Some(js) = occurrencies.remove(&'J') {
            if js == 5 {
                occurrencies.insert('A', 5);
            } else {
                // Find the key with the max value, that is going the one to
                // increase so that we'll have a more powerful hand
                let (max_key, max_value) =
                    occurrencies.iter().max_by_key(|&(_, value)| value).unwrap();
                occurrencies.insert(*max_key, max_value + js);
            }
        }

        // same as before
        let values: Vec<u32> = occurrencies.into_values().collect();
        let r#type = match values.len() {
            1 => HandType::FiveOfAKind,
            4 => HandType::OnePair,
            5 => HandType::HighCard,
            3 => match values.contains(&3) {
                true => HandType::ThreeOfAKind,
                false => HandType::TwoPair,
            },
            2 => match values.contains(&4) {
                true => HandType::FourOfAKind,
                false => HandType::FullHouse,
            },
            _ => panic!("hand with too many cards"),
        };

        r#type
    }
}
```

That's all we need to do to get the correct answer for part 2, which is indeed identical to `fn part1()`.

```rust
fn part2(input: &str) -> io::Result<u32> {
    let mut hands: Vec<Hand> = input.lines().map(Hand::from).collect();
    hands.sort();
    let sum = hands
        .into_iter()
        .enumerate()
        .map(|(i, card)| card.bid * (i as u32 + 1))
        .sum();

    Ok(sum)
}
```

There we go, we have the correct solution for the last part of day 7. The
`#[derive(PartialOrd, Ord)]` was quite nice to learn, still, today's problem was
quite verbose! As we move on I might skip some solutions here as they take just
too much space, but you'll find all the solution on my GitHub :)
