Python is my main language when I'm solving leetcode problems, because I don't
want to focus too much on language when I'm just trying to nail the quiz. I've
been leetcoding for a few weeks now and I wanted to show some useful methods
that I've learned during the process.

I'm writing this more as a personal note than an actual article, with the aim of
keeping it up-to-date for my future self. Despite my best efforts, I tend to
forget many of these things when I visit Leetcode and I haven't been practicing
in a while.

Some of them are trivial, I know, but I used different ways to get the same
result. These are just more elegant and sometimes effortless alternatives.

### Bit count
(Python >3.10)

```python
n = 4329      # 0b1000011101001
n.bit_count() # 6
```

### Check if `str` is a number

```python
"10".isnumeric()         # True
"notAnumber".isnumeric() # False
```

### Set Operations

* Intersection
```python
set([0,1,2]) & set([3,1,2])  # set([1,2])
set([0,1,2]).intersection(set([3,1,2]))
```

* Contains
```python
set([1,2,3]) <= set([1,2,3,5,6,7]) # True
set([1]) <= set([2,3])             # False
set([1,2]) < set([1,2])            # False
```
* Union
```python
set([1,2]) | set([1,3,4])      # set([1,2,3,4])
set([1,2]).union(set([1,3,4]))
```

### Iterate backwards
There are multiple ways to do this, but this is very nice imo.
```python
arr = [1,2,3,4]
for i in range(len(arr)):
    print(arr[~i]) # 4 3 2 1
```

### Iterate Matrix (single index)
```python
mat = [[0, 2], [3, 4], [5, 0]]
m, n = len(mat), len(mat[0])

for i in range(m * n):
    print(mat[i//n][i%n]) # 0 2 3 4 5 0
```

### Merge two dictionaries
(Python >3.9)

```python
s = {k: 0 for k in "abcd"}
d = {k: 1 for k in "lol"}
z = s | d # {'a':0, 'b':0, 'c':0, 'd':0, 'l':1, 'o':1}
```

### Counter intersections

Final result is going to have the keys that both `Counter` have, if
they have different values the min one is going to be kept.

```python
from collections import Counter

a = Counter(list("heeeere"))  # {h: 1, e: 4, r: 1}
b = Counter(list("here!"))    # {h: 1, e: 2, r: 1, !: 1}
z = a & b                     # {h: 1, e: 2, r: 1}
```

### Permutations & Combinations

```python
import itertools

# Order matters
c = itertools.combinations([0,1,2], 2) # [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)]

# Order doesn't matter
p = itertools.permutations([0,1,2], 2) # [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1)]
```
