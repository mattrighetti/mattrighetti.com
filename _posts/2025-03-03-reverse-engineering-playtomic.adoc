Playtomic is probably the biggest application for booking tennis/padel courts in
Europe. Every club that I go to is on Playtomic and that makes it very easy to
book a court or look for upcoming matches. The app is great, which I guess is
why it's so popular.

All this popularity comes at a price though: thousands and thousands of users
competing to get the empty courts as soon they become available. This means that
if you're not fast enough to book a court for the next sunny Saturday, you're
out of luck.

Playtomic offers a premium subscription that gives you special powers, like
getting notifications in advance when courts become available but the price does
not seem to be worth it. Especially if we can get the same by being a little
smart, right?

What I wanted to end up with was some script that notifies me in some kind of
way whenever a specific court becomes available.

That's when I started to get curious about reverse engineering the iOS app that
Playtomic offers

Don't ask me why but when I was doing this yesterday I was not aware that
Playtomic also had a website at https://www.playtomic.io, so there could be an
even easier solution here.
--

The best solution here is to try and find the APIs necessary to query the
available courts.  Once you have that, you can just poll the API every few
minutes and notify yourself when a court becomes available or a schedule
changes.

Where do you look for those APIs when you only have your iPhone's app? In the
app itself of course!

We can try and intercept the network requests that the app makes to its servers
and see if we can find the API that returns us court information.

You can intercept network requests in multiple different ways but the easiest
one is probably by sitting in the middle of the connection between your phone
and the internet. This is usually achieved with a proxy server.

I've used Burp Suite Community Edition for this purpose. While many alternative
tools exist, Burp Suite is widely recognized as a leading penetration testing
platform with extensive documentation. I won't detail the Burp Suite setup
process here, but an excellent guide is available in the references
{intercept-http-traffic-burp}[[0\]]. Once configured with your iPhone using Burp
as a proxy, all iPhone network traffic will be routed through and intercepted by
Burp Suite for analysis.

What's left to do at this point is opening the app and navigate to the screen
where the court information is displayed, that's where the API call to get the
courts availability is probably made.

The process ended up being a lot easier than I thought, and after fiddling a
couple of minutes with the app and frenetically popping up courts availability
pages I was able to find the API call that I was looking for:

```http
GET /v1/availability?sport_id=PADEL&start_max=2025-03-06T23:59:59&start_min=2025-03-06T00:00:00&tenant_id=2ab75436-9bb0-4e9c-9a6f-b12931a9ca4a
Host: api.playtomic.io
Content-Type: application/json
X-Datadog-Parent-Id: ********

X-Datadog-Tags: _dd.p.tid=67c4561000000000
X-Datadog-Origin: rum
Traceparent: ********
Connection: keep-alive
```

This looks like a classic authenticated request to the endpoint
`/v1/availability` with some query parameters: `sport_id=PADEL`,
`start_max=2025-03-06T23:59:59`, `start_min=2025-03-06T00:00:00` and `tenant_id`
which corresponds to the courts that I usually go to.

In this case we've been quite lucky and Burp was able to intercept the traffic
without a single issue.  Nowadays, a lot of applications will use SSL pinning to
prevent this kind of interception. This is a topic for another day, but it's
worth mentioning that there are ways to bypass SSL pinning and still intercept
the traffic.

Let's go on and play with the API! I bet we don't need most of the request
headers displayed above. Let's try and get rid of all the analytics and tracking
stuff and see if we can still get a `200` from the Playtomic APIs.

```http
GET /v1/availability?sport_id=PADEL&start_max=2025-03-06T23:59:59&start_min=2025-03-06T00:00:00&tenant_id=2ab75436-9bb0-4e9c-9a6f-b12931a9ca4a

```

Nice! The server seems to be okay if we just provide the bare minimum, but what if
we also remove the `Authorization` header?

```http
GET /v1/availability?sport_id=PADEL&start_max=2025-03-06T23:59:59&start_min=2025-03-06T00:00:00&tenant_id=2ab75436-9bb0-4e9c-9a6f-b12931a9ca4a

X-Requested-With: com.playtomic.app 6.13.0
User-Agent: iOS 18.3.1

>>>

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
...
```

Can't get any better than this, we don't even need to be authenticated to call
the API! This saved us a bunch of time and effort that we would have spent
trying to reverse engineer the authentication mechanism.

It would be cool if we could ask for an entire month of availability, maybe we can tweak the `start_max` and `start_min` parameters to achieve that:

```http
GET /v1/availability?sport_id=PADEL&start_max=2025-04-06T23:59:59&start_min=2025-03-06T00:00:00&tenant_id=2ab75436-9bb0-4e9c-9a6f-b12931a9ca4a
Host: api.playtomic.io
Content-Type: application/json
X-Requested-With: com.playtomic.app 6.13.0
User-Agent: iOS 18.3.1

>>>

HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
...
{
  "localized_message": "Not allowed to request more than 25h",
  "status": "INCORRECT_PARAMETERS"
}
```

The server doesn't seem to like that, indeed we can only request a maximum of 25
hours of availability at a time. That's a bummer, but we can work with that.

Let's start building a script that queries the API and returns us with the
availability of the courts.  I'm only playing during weekends so it makes sense
for me to have a lookahead window of 2 weeks, only asking specifically for the
weekends.

I haven't been posting Go in a while on this blog, I feel like that would be the best language for this task.
Let's define our structs first:

```go
// Slot represents a single availability slot
type Slot struct {
	StartTime string `json:"start_time"` // Start time of the slot (e.g., "09:30:00")
	Duration  int    `json:"duration"`   // Duration of the slot in minutes
	Price     string `json:"price"`      // Price of the slot (e.g., "48 GBP")
}

// AvailabilityResponse represents the entire JSON response
type AvailabilityResponse struct {
	ResourceID string `json:"resource_id"` // Resource ID (e.g., "3df036e3-7dba-4c39-b966-ab088edaade4")
	StartDate  string `json:"start_date"`  // Start date of the availability (e.g., "2025-03-06")
	Slots      []Slot `json:"slots"`       // List of available slots
}
```

I'd then need a function to conveniently get the days of the weekend for the next 2 weeks:

```go
// getNextWeekends returns the next two Saturdays and Sundays from today
func getNextWeekends() []time.Time {
	today := time.Now()
	var weekends []time.Time

	// Find the next Saturday and Sunday
	daysUntilSaturday := (time.Saturday - today.Weekday() + 7) % 7
	nextSaturday := today.AddDate(0, 0, int(daysUntilSaturday))
	nextSunday := nextSaturday.AddDate(0, 0, 1)

	// Add the next two weekends
	weekends = append(weekends, nextSaturday, nextSunday)
	weekends = append(weekends, nextSaturday.AddDate(0, 0, 7), nextSunday.AddDate(0, 0, 7))

	return weekends
}
```

And a function to build the request that is going to be issued for a single date:

```go
// buildGetRequest builds a GET request for the given target date
func buildGetRequest(targetDate time.Time) (*http.Request, error) {
	// Base URL
	baseURL := "https://api.playtomic.io/v1/availability"

	// Derive start and end times from the target date
	startDate := time.Date(targetDate.Year(), targetDate.Month(), targetDate.Day(), 0, 0, 0, 0, targetDate.Location())
	endDate := time.Date(targetDate.Year(), targetDate.Month(), targetDate.Day(), 23, 59, 59, 0, targetDate.Location())

	// Query parameters
	params := url.Values{}
	params.Add("sport_id", "PADEL")
	params.Add("start_min", startDate.Format("2006-01-02T15:04:05"))
	params.Add("start_max", endDate.Format("2006-01-02T15:04:05"))
	params.Add("tenant_id", "2ab75436-9bb0-4e9c-9a6f-b12931a9ca4a")

	// Construct the full URL with query parameters
	fullURL := fmt.Sprintf("%s?%s", baseURL, params.Encode())

	// Create the GET request
	req, err := http.NewRequest("GET", fullURL, nil)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to create request: %w", err)
	}

	return req, nil
}
```

Finally, we can issue the request and parse the response with this other function:

```go
// fetchAvailability fetches the availability for the given target date
func fetchAvailability(targetDate time.Time) ([]AvailabilityResponse, error) {
	// Build the GET request
	req, err := buildGetRequest(targetDate)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("error building request: %w", err)
	}

	// Make the HTTP request
	client := &http.Client{}
	resp, err := client.Do(req)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("error making request: %w", err)
	}
	defer resp.Body.Close()

	// Read the response body
	body, err := io.ReadAll(resp.Body)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("error reading response body: %w", err)
	}

	// Parse the JSON response into a slice of AvailabilityResponse
	var availability []AvailabilityResponse
	err = json.Unmarshal(body, &availability)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("error unmarshalling JSON: %w", err)
	}

	return availability, nil
}
```

This is a good start, we could now call `fetchAvailability` and with a bit of pretty printing logic we can get a table
with the available slots for the next two weekends.

```go
func main() {
	// Get the next two Saturdays and Sundays
	weekends := getNextWeekends()

	// Fetch availability for each date
	availabilityByDate := make(map[string][]Slot)
	for _, targetDate := range weekends {
		fmt.Printf("Fetching availability for date: %s\n", targetDate.Format("2006-01-02"))

		// Fetch availability
		availabilities, err := fetchAvailability(targetDate)
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Printf("Error fetching availability: %v\n", err)
			continue
		}

		// Process each availability response
		for _, availability := range availabilities {
			// Append slots to the date key
			availabilityByDate[availability.StartDate] = append(availabilityByDate[availability.StartDate], availability.Slots...)
		}
	}

    fmt.Println(prettyPrintTable(availabilityByDate))
}
```

```console
$ go run main.go
DATE         START TIME  DURATION
2025-03-08   19:00:00       60
2025-03-09   20:00:00       60
```

This is just what I wanted, now we need to think of a way to get this delivered
somewhere to us so that we can rush to the app and book the court whenever our
favorite slot becomes available.

Running this script in a cron job every 10 minutes would do it, but I don't want to be notified every single time
a request is made. Ideally, for a first iteration I would like to get notified only when a new slot becomes available or
another slot is removed. Basically, I want to receive a notification whenever the availability changes in any way.

We can detect a change in availability by comparing the hash of the new and previous table of slots. Whenever the hash changes,
the script would need to store a file containing the hash of the current table of slots so that it can be compared the next time
a request is issued.

```go
// computeHash computes a SHA-256 hash of the availability data
func computeHash(data map[string][]Slot) string {
	jsonData, err := json.Marshal(data)
	if err != nil {
		return ""
	}
	hash := sha256.Sum256(jsonData)
	return hex.EncodeToString(hash[:])
}
```

We have a couple of options when it comes to notifications, the two most common
ones that I always use are emails and Slack. For this particular case I'm going
to use email, I can send the notification to all of my friends without actually
creating a Slack channel just for that, which seems a bit too much work.

```go
// notify sends an email notification using Gmail using App passwords
func notify(message string) {
	// Gmail account credentials
	from := "my-supersecret-email@youwillneverknow.com"
	password := os.Getenv("SMTP_PWD")

	// List of recipients
	subscribers := os.Getenv("SUBSCRIBERS")
	var to []string

	err := json.Unmarshal([]byte(subscribers), &to)
	if err != nil {
		panic("cannot parse emails")
	}

	// SMTP server configuration
	smtpHost := "smtp.gmail.com"
	smtpPort := "587"

	// Email content
	subject := "Playtomic Update"
	body := fmt.Sprintf("The availability table has changed:\n\n%s", message)

	// Construct the email message
	msg := fmt.Sprintf("From: %s\nTo: %s\nSubject: %s\n\n%s",
		from, strings.Join(to, ","), subject, body)

	// Authenticate and send the email
	auth := smtp.PlainAuth("", from, password, smtpHost)
	err = smtp.SendMail(smtpHost+":"+smtpPort, auth, from, to, []byte(msg))
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error sending email: %v\n", err)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Email notification sent successfully!")
	}
}
```

We can make use of these two new functions now

```go
func main() {
	// Get the next two Saturdays and Sundays
	weekends := getNextWeekends()

	// Fetch availability for each date
	availabilityByDate := make(map[string][]Slot)
	for _, targetDate := range weekends {
		fmt.Printf("Fetching availability for date: %s\n", targetDate.Format("2006-01-02"))

		// Fetch availability
		availabilities, err := fetchAvailability(targetDate)
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Printf("Error fetching availability: %v\n", err)
			continue
		}

		// Process each availability response
		for _, availability := range availabilities {
			// Append slots to the date key
			availabilityByDate[availability.StartDate] = append(availabilityByDate[availability.StartDate], availability.Slots...)
		}
	}

	// Compute the hash of the current availability data
	currentHash := computeHash(availabilityByDate)

	// Read the previous hash from a file (if it exists)
	var previousHash string
	hashFile := "availability_hash.txt"
	if _, err := os.Stat(hashFile); err == nil {
		hashBytes, err := os.ReadFile(hashFile)
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Printf("Error reading hash file: %v\n", err)
		} else {
			previousHash = string(hashBytes)
		}
	}

	// Compare hashes to detect changes
	if currentHash != previousHash {
		// Write the new hash to the file
		err := os.WriteFile(hashFile, []byte(currentHash), 0644)
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Printf("Error writing hash file: %v\n", err)
		}

		// Write the table to a file
		outputFile := "availability_table.txt"
		err = writeTableToFile(outputFile, availabilityByDate)
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Printf("Error writing table to file: %v\n", err)
		} else {
			fmt.Printf("Table written to %s\n", outputFile)
		}

		// Send a notification
		notify(prettyPrintTable(availabilityByDate))
	} else {
		fmt.Println("No changes detected in the availability table.")
	}
}
```

If I run this now, I'm going to get an email to my inbox, a self-sent email
because I'm currently using my own email address to send the notifications.

```console
$ SUBSCRIBERS="[\"my-supersecret-email@youwillneverknow.com\"]" SMTP_PWD="secret" go run main.go
```

With that, we have our script that notifies us whenever the availability of the
courts changes. What's left to do is write a cron job that runs this script periodically.

I could have written my cron job so that it runs every 10 minutes on one of my
raspis at home, but I have a better and more reliable solution: GitHub Actions.

Did you know you can run cron jobs on GitHub Actions? It's a great way to run
periodic tasks without having to worry about the infrastructure. Plus, if
something goes wrong, you can always check the logs on GitHub on the go, which
is not always super convenient if the cron job is running in your LAN.

[chat,matt]
--
Don't trust me on this one, but another advantage here is that Github Actions
runners will change the IP address every time they run, so you can't be easily
blocked by the Playtomic servers and those will look like legitimate requests.
--

Here's the CI/CD pipeline configuration file

```yaml
name: Run Availability Checker

on:
  schedule:
    # Run every 10 minutes
    - cron: '*/10 * * * *'
  workflow_dispatch: # Allow manual triggering

jobs:
  check-availability:

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v4
        with:
          go-version: '1.24'

      # We can leverage the runner's cache to store the hash of the availability table
      - name: Restore hash cache
        id: cache-hash
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: availability_hash.txt
          key: availability-hash

      # Run the Go program
      - name: Run Go program
        env:
          SUBSCRIBERS: ${{ secrets.SUBSCRIBERS }}
          SMTP_PWD: ${{ secrets.SMTP_PWD }}
        run: |
          echo ${{ env.SUBSCRIBERS }}
          go run main.go

      # Save the hash file to cache
      - name: Save hash cache
        if: steps.cache-hash.outputs.cache-hit != 'true'
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: availability_hash.txt
          key: availability-hash
```

That is it! I can now sit back and relax, knowing that I will be notified
whenever a court becomes available and I'll be able to book it, or at least have
a chance to do so.
