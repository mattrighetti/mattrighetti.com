title: Dream Terminal

:source-highlighter: rouge
:page-liquid:

I recently switched to the new M2 MacBook and as a common ritual, I have to set
it up from scratch. My old MacBook that mounted an Intel i9 is in the corner
crying at 80ºC but it will be fine.

I spend 99% of my time in the terminal so as you can imagine I want it to feel
fast and look good. The first thing that I usually setup is
https://ohmyz.sh[**oh-my-zsh**], it's as easy as running this one-liner in the
terminal

```shell session
$ sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

This is going to give your terminal a clean look with just the bare minimum
stuff that you actually need to see up-front. Next up is syntax-highlighting and
suggestions. These are super useful especially if you don't want to type 50
chars commands every time. The plugins that I use are
https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git[zsh-syntax-highlighting],
https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions.git[zsh-autosuggestions],
https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions.git[zsh-completions]. zsh has a
special folder in which you must put your plugins, and that folder is
`.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins`, and this is exactly where I put the three plugins
above

```shell session
ZSH_CUSTOM=$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git  $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions.git      $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions.git          $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/zsh-completions
```

At this point zsh has almost reached perfection for what I need, as soon as you
type something it's going to show a dimmed suggestion based on your previous
commands.

Another must-have tool is https://brew.sh[Homebrew]. I have a script that is
going to install pretty much every app, font and binary that I need on my new
machine. This is super convenient because you just need to run a one-liner and
when it finishes you're going to have EVERYTHING that I usually install on every
Mac that I have, without the need to visit 100 different websites, clicking a
thousand different hyperlinks to download every application or binary that I use
day-to-day.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Check for Homebrew
# Install if not present
if test ! $(which brew); then
    echo "Installing Homebrew 🍺..."
    echo | /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

Homebrew takes a little bit of time at first to sync and install all the
dependencies but it's a great tool that everyone should have on their machine, I
also use it on Linux and it's super useful there too. Also, the script is pretty
concise and readable, I just create a couple of arrays to better see what I want
to install and expand those in the installation commands at the bottom.

If you read all the stuff that I installed with Homebrew you certainly noticed
that I installed https://alacritty.org[Alacritty], which is a super cool and
fast terminal emulator (written is Rust, it's a trend to point this out 😌 ).
Ditch the default terminal app, it's crap.

I would like to point out just a thing I have going on with Alacritty, you can
find the entire
https://github.com/mattrighetti/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml[alacritty.yml]
config file on my GitHub.

```yml
shell:
  program: /opt/homebrew/bin/tmux
  args:
    - new-session
    - -A
    - -D
    - -s
    - main
```

[warn]
--
If you are not using a M* Mac then your homebrew folder
is going to be `/usr/local/` and not `/opt/homebrew/`
--

With this you are basically telling Alacritty to open a `tmux` session each time
you open the terminal emulator app, this way you don't have to run it yourself
every single time you boot up your system.

At this point I'm almost done, I just need my config files in the right place. I
usually put all my config files in `$HOME/.config`, and every binary that does
not parse config files in that folder does not deserve to be installed. Also, I
manage all my dotfiles with https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11071754[this] little trick. I have
different branches for different systems, but for the moment I'm just assuming
that everything is on the `master` branch.

```shell session
$ git init --bare $HOME/.cfg
$ alias config='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfg/ --work-tree=$HOME'
$ config config status.showUntrackedFiles no
$ config pull -u origin master
```

And magically all my dotfiles are cloned in the right place, nothing is broken
and everything is versioned so that if I need to make some changes I can always
keep track of them and sync them with my remote repository.

```shell session
$ tree .config
.config

```

This is all that I usually do when I have to setup a Mac from scratch (and Linux
too), it's the easiest and fastest way possible to do it. Is there anything
better than running approximately 10 commands to setup your machine entirely?

Now I can sit back and enjoy my fresh, minimal and fast terminal.
