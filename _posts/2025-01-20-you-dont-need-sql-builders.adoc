:so-question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74956100/how-to-build-safe-dynamic-query-with-sqlx-in-rust

In a previous {prev-article}[[0\]] post I've discussed why I ditched sea-query and why sql is almost
always the best way to not re-learn something new from the beginning that will
inevitably end up slowing you down or simply not working at all in the long run.

From time to time, I still stumble upon stackoverflow questions like this one
{so-question}[[1\]].

OP is basically asking for a way to dynamically build a query based on a
search filter that is declared like the following

```rust
struct Search {
    id: i64,
    username: Option<String>,
    min_age: Option<i8>,
    max_age: Option<i8>,
}
```

You may agree that this is a very common scenario in every single API that's out
there. You have an endpoint that returns some items and you want to expose a way
to filter those items so that the client can ask only for things it's interested in.

What's even more interesting is that all the answers to OP involve some kind of
_complex_ way to build the query and `if` and `else` that, at least in that
case, are most likely unnecessary.

One of the answers suggests the following implementation

```rust
fn search_query(search: Search) -> String {
    let mut query = QueryBuilder::new("SELECT * from users where id = ");
    query.push_bind(search.id);

    if let Some(username) = search.username {
        query.push(" AND username = ");
        query.push_bind(username);
    }

    if let Some(min_age) = search.min_age {
        query.push(" AND age > ");
        query.push_bind(min_age);
    }

    if let Some(max_age) = search.max_age {
        query.push(" AND age < ");
        query.push_bind(max_age);
    }

    query.build().sql().into()
}
```

The above solution works just fine, sure - the fact that the field `id` is
always present in the `Search` filter simplifies stuff a bit. What if `id` was
an `Option<i64>`? If you want to keep using the query builder you'd need to
introduce another `if` statement checking if the `id` is present or not

```rust
fn search_query(search: Search) -> String {
    let mut query = QueryBuilder::new("SELECT * from users");

    if let Some(id) = search.id {
        query.push(" AND id = ");
        query.push_bind(search.id);
    }

    if let Some(username) = search.username {
        query.push(" AND username = ");
        query.push_bind(username);
    }

    if let Some(min_age) = search.min_age {
        query.push(" AND age > ");
        query.push_bind(min_age);
    }

    if let Some(max_age) = search.max_age {
        query.push(" AND age < ");
        query.push_bind(max_age);
    }

    query.build().sql().into()
}
```

Mmmh, the query seems to be broken now!
--

If each field is `None` the query will work just fine, if one of them is at
least `Some(_)` the query won't work because that will translate to `SELECT
* from users AND username = 'testname'`. A quick fix would be adding a `WHERE 1 =
1` clause at the beginning of the query

```rust
fn search_query(search: Search) -> String {
    let mut query = QueryBuilder::new("SELECT * from users WHERE 1 = 1");

    if let Some(id) = search.id {
        query.push(" AND id = ");
        query.push_bind(search.id);
    }

    if let Some(username) = search.username {
        query.push(" AND username = ");
        query.push_bind(username);
    }

    if let Some(min_age) = search.min_age {
        query.push(" AND age > ");
        query.push_bind(min_age);
    }

    if let Some(max_age) = search.max_age {
        query.push(" AND age < ");
        query.push_bind(max_age);
    }

    query.build().sql().into()
}
```

Ahhh it's working again now!
--

[chat,matt]
--
Yep, that was an easy fix, but we can do even better
--

The `sqlx` crate is capable of handling `Option<T>` types easily: if the value
is `Some(_)` that will be used in the binding, otherwise sqlx will bind `NULL`
for `None` values. With that in mind we can use SQL to only apply those `WHERE`
clauses if the value `IS NOT NULL`.

The function above becomes

```rust
async fn search_query(search: Search) -> String {
    let query = r"
    SELECT * from users
    WHERE id = $1
        AND ($2 IS NULL OR username = $2)
        AND ($3 IS NULL or age > $3)
        AND ($4 IS NULL or age < $4)
    ".into()
}
```

[chat,matt]

Note that you need to use check for IS NULL to avoid running the filtering when
the value is None
--

This approach does not let you push bindings one by one as the previous method,
but you don't actually need it here, you can bind values all at once later.
Let's query the data directly

```rust
async fn search_query(search: Search, pg: &PgPool) {
    let query = sqlx::query(r"
    SELECT * FROM users
    WHERE id = $1
        AND ($2 IS NULL OR username = $2)
        AND ($3 IS NULL OR age > $3)
        AND ($4 IS NULL OR age < $4)
    ")
    .bind(search.id)
    .bind(search.username)
    .bind(search.min_age)
    .bind(search.max_age)
    .fetch_all(pg)
    .await
    .expect("failed querying users");
}
```

This is what I usually prefer, it looks nicer and I don't have to write more
Rust logic that I'd have to test later. The dynamically built query shown before
can end up being 16 different queries, on the other hand you only have one query
if you exclusively use sql.

Another reason why I prefer to do queries this way is that I can copy and paste
the statement in Datagrip and test it directly in the database, mimicking what
`sqlx` will end up doing.

In the following examples I am using Postgres syntax, it may be different for
other engines like Sqlite or MySql
--

By now you should have a better idea of how you can work with sql to reduce the
Rust logic that's involved in your queries, but I'd like to give some other
common examples and functions you can work with.

A common type that I encounter pretty frequently is a `Vec<T>`. Most of the
times I do not want to filter at all if `vec.is_empty()`. To make this a bit
more complicated let's consider the scenario where I have an `Option<Vec<T>>`
and I only want to apply the filter if `!vec.is_empty()`.

```rust
async fn filter(nicknames: Option<Vec<i64>>, pg: &PgPool) {
    sqlx::query(
        r"SELECT *
        FROM users
        WHERE 1 = 1
            AND ($1 IS NULL
                 OR CARDINALITY($1::integer[]) = 0
                 OR nickname = $1
            )"
    )
    .bind(nicknames)
    .fetch_all(pg)
    .await
    .unwrap();
}
```

Let's break it down:

- `$1 IS NULL` is satisfied if `nicknames.is_none()` and won't apply the filter

- `CARDINALITY($1::integer[])` stops the filtering if `nickname.is_some() &&
  nickname.unwrap().len() = 0`

- Finally, if the vector is not `None` and its length is greater than one then
  `nickname = $1` will filter all the users that have `nickname` as nickname

Let's move on to another similar scenario, this time you have a vector
represented as string with comma separated values: you may have an endpoint that
accepts a query parameter with multiple values separated by a comma (e.g
`?ids=11,22,33,44`). My naive-self in the past used to create a fancy
custom deserializer function that transformed `11,22,33,44` from a `String` into
a `Vec<i64>` and that is useless work that could have easily been handled by the
database.

```rust
async fn filter(ids: String, pg: &PgPool) {
    sqlx::query(
        r"SELECT *
        FROM users
        WHERE
            id IN (ARRAY_REMOVE(STRING_TO_ARRAY($1, ','), ''))"
    )
    .bind(ids)
    .fetch_all(pg)
    .await
    .unwrap();
}
```

The syntax above works for Postgres but may be different for other database
servers. I'm sure such a basic feature is available on most of them and you
can use it.
--

`(ARRAY_REMOVE(STRING_TO_ARRAY($1, ','), '')` creates an array of
ids by splitting comma separated values and also removes empty values in
case someone decides to mess with your backend and tries to pass
`?ids=11,,,`.

The next feature I'd like to explore is probably the de-facto API must-have:
pagination. Pagination basically lets your client say "give me page 2 with a
maximum of 10 items in it". You can model that filter with the following struct

```rust
struct Filter {
    /// current page
    pub page: Option<i64>,
    /// number of items per page
    pub limit_per_page: Option<i64>
}
```

I've marked them as `Option<i64>` because clients are rude and want you to do
the guessing. Most of them won't ask for a specific page but they really want
the fist one. Also, if the client is lazy and does not provide a
`limit_per_page` you should fallback to a good default value to not overload
your Postgres instance.

Pagination is tricky because a user could pass a `?page=-100` and negative pages
do not exist. You could have avoided that by using an `Option<u64>` but then
you'd have to cast that value to an `i64` whenever you want to bind that to a
query (in Postgres at least). To make things worse, an hacker could request a
`limit_per_page=1000000000` to make your server crash and wake you up while
you're sleeping because your app is dead.

My less sql-centric self would have implemented a filter validation to check for its correctness

```rust
impl Filter {
    fn validate(&self) -> Result<(), String> {
        match self.page {
            Some(page) if page < 0 => {
                return Err("page can't be negative")
            }
            _ => {}
        }

        match self.limit_per_page {
            Some(limit) if limit < 10 && limit > 100 {
                return Err("limit must be between 10 and 100")
            }
            _ => {}
        }

        Ok(())
    }
}
```

But guess what... SQL has the solution for you

```rust
async fn filter(filter: Filter, pg: &PgPool) {
    sqlx::query(
    r"SELECT *
    FROM users
    LIMIT
        CASE WHEN $2 > 0 THEN $2 END
    OFFSET
        CASE
            WHEN $2 BETWEEN 0 AND 100 AND $1 > 0
                THEN (($1 - 1) * $2)
            ELSE
                50
        END"
    )
    // if page is not provided, fallback to 0
    .bind(filter.page.unwrap_or(0))
    // if limit is not provided, fallback to 50
    .bind(filter.limit_per_page.unwrap_or(50))
    .fetch_all(pg)
    .await
    .unwrap();
}
```

The `LIMIT` statement is only applied if the passed value is greater than zero,
on the other hand the `OFFSET` is applied only if the passed
`limit_per_page` is between zero and a hundred and the `page` is not
negative, all other cases are defaulted to `OFFSET 50`.

Lastly, I'd like to cover an `UPDATE` statement which I feel is also quite
common in APIs out there. Let's say we have an `UpdateForm` struct that models
our HTML form.

```rust
struct UpdateForm {
    id: Uuid
    name: Option<String>
    surname: Option<String>
}
```

This form takes the user unique id and, optionally, its name and surname. I want
to provide a way for my client to only update the value that it passes to my
backend with a `Some(_)` value. Seems like we can do just that with the use of `COALESCE`

```rust
async fn update_user(UpdateForm { id, name, surname }: UpdateForm, pg: &PgPool) {
    sqlx::query(
        r"UPDATE user
        SET name = COALESCE($2, name),
            surname = COALESCE($3, surname)
        WHERE id = $1"
    )
    .bind(id)
    .bind(name)
    .bind(surname)
    .fetch_one(pg)
    .await
    .unwrap();
}
```

The query above uses `COALESCE` to only update those values that are
`.is_some()`, the others will remain the same and no update will take place.

[chat, matt]

Neat! be mindful, `COALESCE` will return the first non-null value in its
statement, so order matters!
--

As you can see we've got a lot done by employing sql alone, you can get smart
with it and avoid writing over-complicated Rust logic in your queries, isn't
that a neater and better solution overall?
