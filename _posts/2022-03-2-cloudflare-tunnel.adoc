Lately I've been interested a lot in the self-hosting word, I donâ€™t want
to spend 100$ a month for an EC2 machine on AWS to play around with some hobby projects, 
and self-hosting was my best bet to contain costs and have a powerful machine
at the same time. This is what I initially thought at least!

Turns out that networking is super interesting, but networking stuff can easily become
pricy. 

A good pfsense router costs around 200$, a switch almost double.
