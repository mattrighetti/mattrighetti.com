title: Environment Variables & Rust
---

If you've ever worked on some kind of project you definitley have
encountered the need to declare some environment variables for it.

Environment variables are an easy way to setup essential parameters
that your program is going to use at runtime, i.e database URL, tracing level,
production or local environment.

In Rust you have multiple ways to make use of them

```rust
use axum::{response::Html, routing::get, Router};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // let's get our database
    let db_connection_str = std::env::var("DATABASE_URL")
        .expect("cannot find DATABASE_URL env");

    let pool = PgPoolOptions::new()
        .max_connections(5)
        .acquire_timeout(Duration::from_secs(3))
        .connect(&db_connection_str)
        .await
        .expect("can't connect to database");

    let app = Router::new().route("/", get(handler)).with_state(pool);
    let listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:3000")
        .await
        .unwrap();
    println!("listening on {}", listener.local_addr().unwrap());
    axum::serve(listener, app).await.unwrap();
}

async fn handler() -> Html<&'static str> {
    Html("<h1>Hello, World!</h1>")
}
```

With the example above, the program expects to find `DATABASE_URL` in the process environment variables.
To make it work you'd have to run

```shell session
$ export DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:password@localhost"
$ cargo run
```

Or you could use a simple one liner

```shell session
DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:password@localhost" cargo run
```

Both of these will run the program okay, but there are some issues you might want to look out for:

1. The command/s above are now stored in your `~/.[zsh|bash|fish]_history` file
   now, in plaintext, and that's bad, especially when you type out the
   production database password
2. You have to type that everytime you are in a new shell session, that's
   especially bad if you have a terrible shell config without autocompletion and
   suggestions (please, do yourself a favor and fix that)

Come on... everybody uses .env files nowadays!
--

I know, I know, you already know all that, it's basic software dev stuff after all.

In order to not leak sensitive data, we can use a
`.env` file in the project's folder (I'll talk about how I F-up with those
files one day). There's a pretty common crate in Rust to read environment variables
at runtime and that's https://github.com/dotenv-rs/dotenv/tree/master[`dotenv`].


`dotenv` will check if you have a `.env` file in your project's folder and
_load_ the env variables in there for you. Here's how the whole thing would look like:

```shell session
$ cat .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:password@localhost"
```

```rust
use dotenv::dotenv;
use axum::{response::Html, routing::get, Router};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // load environments from .env
    dotenv().ok();

    // let's get our database
    let db_connection_str = std::env::var("DATABASE_URL")
        .expect("cannot find DATABASE_URL env");

    let pool = PgPoolOptions::new()
        .max_connections(5)
        .acquire_timeout(Duration::from_secs(3))
        .connect(&db_connection_str)
        .await
        .expect("can't connect to database");

    let app = Router::new().route("/", get(handler)).with_state(pool);
    let listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:3000")
        .await
        .unwrap();
    println!("listening on {}", listener.local_addr().unwrap());
    axum::serve(listener, app).await.unwrap();
}

async fn handler() -> Html<&'static str> {
    Html("<h1>Hello, World!</h1>")
}
```

I see `dotenv` used all over the place, but there's another way to achieve the
same without the `.env` file.

Since Cargo 1.56 you can use https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/config.html#env[configurable-env]

The [env] section allows you to set additional environment variables for build
scripts, rustc invocations, cargo run and cargo build.

I prefer this method to the `dotenv` one because it does pretty much the same
and the environment variables are set by `cargo` itself instead of the program
runtime. Also, most of my deployments don't have a `.env` file to parse, but I
just set environment variables in the container itself or in the parent process
and this approach better simulates that kind of setup.

Let's get rid of `dotenv` and use `.cargo/config.toml`

```shell session
$ rm .env
$ cat .cargo/config.toml
[env]
DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:password@localhost"
```

```rust
use axum::{response::Html, routing::get, Router};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // it's the same as the first iteration, if you don't find
    // differences it's because there's none :)

    // let's get our database
    let db_connection_str = std::env::var("DATABASE_URL")
        .expect("cannot find DATABASE_URL env");

    let pool = PgPoolOptions::new()
        .max_connections(5)
        .acquire_timeout(Duration::from_secs(3))
        .connect(&db_connection_str)
        .await
        .expect("can't connect to database");

    let app = Router::new().route("/", get(handler)).with_state(pool);
    let listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:3000")
        .await
        .unwrap();
    println!("listening on {}", listener.local_addr().unwrap());
    axum::serve(listener, app).await.unwrap();
}

async fn handler() -> Html<&'static str> {
    Html("<h1>Hello, World!</h1>")
}
```

Much neater, and we removed a crate from the project dependencies. But we're not
done yet, there's another scenario that we've not yet talked about.

Up until now we've only covered environment variables that won't change
frequently, that is the reason why we can easily create a file and write them
there and we'd be okay forever. What if we need environment variables that need
to change very frequently? Or that depend on complex logic? Or some command?

It's common in a lot of open source programs to see their commit hash somewhere
to indicate that the version that you're currently using is the one that has
that HEAD commit. How would you do that in Rust?

Well, turns out that it's easily achievable with the `build.rs` file.

Placing a file named build.rs in the root of a package will cause Cargo to
compile that script and execute it just before building the package.
--

Within `build.rs` we can provide whatever environment variable we want to
the `rustc` compiler by using `println!("cargo:rustc-env=...")`, that way we can
expose that value into our project at compiletime.

```rust
// [build.rs]
fn main() {
    set_revision_hash();
}

// pass the result of `git rev-parse --short=10 HEAD` to rustc
fn set_revision_hash() {
    use std::process::Command;

    let args = &["rev-parse", "--short=10", "HEAD"];
    let Ok(output) = Command::new("git").args(args).output() else {
        return;
    };

    let rev = String::from_utf8_lossy(&output.stdout).trim().to_string();
    if rev.is_empty() {
        return;
    }

    println!("cargo:rustc-env=BUILD_GIT_HASH={}", rev);
}
```

With that in place we can make use `BUILD_GIT_HASH` in our program

```rust
use axum::{response::Html, routing::get, Router};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // let's get our database
    let db_connection_str = std::env::var("DATABASE_URL")
        .expect("cannot find DATABASE_URL env");

    let pool = PgPoolOptions::new()
        .max_connections(5)
        .acquire_timeout(Duration::from_secs(3))
        .connect(&db_connection_str)
        .await
        .expect("can't connect to database");

    let app = Router::new()
        .route("/", get(handler))
        // here we can now take that environment
        // at compiletime with env!()
        .route("/_meta", get(|| async { env!("BUILD_GIT_HASH") }))
        .with_state(pool);

    let listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:3000")
        .await
        .unwrap();

    println!("listening on {}", listener.local_addr().unwrap());
    axum::serve(listener, app).await.unwrap();
}

async fn handler() -> Html<&'static str> {
    Html("<h1>Welcome!</h1>")
}
```

Notice that this time I've used the `env!` macro, which takes environment
variables at *compiletime* and not at *runtime*, big difference there!

I'm sure there are other infinite ways to do what I've explained above, but
these are the ones that I've seen used the most.

To be fair, I've been a `dotenv` guy for quite some time when I first started
with Rust, but I've discovered the `.cargo/config.toml` alternative recently
even though it's been around for a long time, so I hope it's something new for
you too.
